# ✅ Session Complete - Infrastructure Tasks

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
- Multi-version Node.js testing (16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
- Automated test runs with `npm test`
- TypeScript type checking
- Build verification
- Lint checks (non-blocking)
- Lighthouse CI for pull requests
- Build artifact uploads

### 2. WiT Risk Score Calculator
Created command-line tool for risk score calculations:

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/calculateRiskScore.js` - JavaScript version (runs directly)
- `scripts/calculateRiskScore.ts` - TypeScript version (for compilation)
- `scripts/example-params.json` - Example parameters file
- `scripts/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**Features**:
- Full parameter support via CLI flags
- JSON file input for batch processing
- Detailed emissions breakdown
- Risk score calculation (0-100)
- Risk category assignment
- Loan leverage analysis
- Actionable recommendations
- JSON output option

**Usage Example**:
```bash
node scripts/calculateRiskScore.js --herd-size 100 --milk-yield 8000 --loan-amount 50000
```

### 3. Stakeholder Testing Framework
Created `tests/stakeholder-scenarios.md` with:

**Test Scenarios**:
1. High-Performing Pasture Farm
2. Intensive Confined System
3. Struggling Small Farm
4. Progressive Carbon-Neutral Farm

**Framework Includes**:
- Detailed parameters for each scenario
- Expected results ranges
- Validation points
- Test procedures checklist
- User experience evaluation
- Feedback forms
- Risk matrix validation
- Technical issues log

## All Pending Tasks Completed ✓

The three remaining tasks from the todo list have been implemented:
1. ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
2. ✅ Implement WiT_Risk_Score calculation script
3. ✅ Create stakeholder testing framework (execution pending)

## Current Project Status

- **All V4 features**: Implemented and deployed
- **Documentation**: Complete and comprehensive
- **Testing infrastructure**: Ready for use
- **Risk calculator**: Available as CLI tool
- **Stakeholder validation**: Framework ready, execution pending

## What's Next

The only remaining task is to execute the stakeholder testing:
1. Run testing sessions with real users
2. Collect feedback using the provided framework
3. Analyze results
4. Make any necessary adjustments based on feedback

The project is now fully feature-complete with all infrastructure in place!
