# üöÄ GHG WHAT-IF Tool v4.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Version**: 4.0.0  
**Status**: Production Ready  

## üéØ Executive Summary

Version 4.0 represents a major milestone in the GHG WHAT-IF Tool evolution, introducing the concept of **Theoretical Minimum (TM)** - the biological floor for dairy emissions. This release empowers farmers to understand not just their current emissions, but how close they can get to the theoretical best-case scenario, with detailed pathways and financing options to get there.

## ‚ú® Major Features

### 1. Theoretical Minimum (TM) Tracking
- **Biological Floor**: Set at 2000 kg CO‚ÇÇe/cow/year based on scientific research
- **Visual Indicators**: TM line appears on all relevant charts
- **Gap Analysis**: Shows percentage above TM and feasibility of reaching it
- **Regional Variations**: Reference values for UK (2200), NZ (1700), EU (2100)

### 2. Reduction Pathway Engine
- **8 Reduction Measures** with ROI analysis:
  - Feed quality improvements (up to 15% reduction)
  - Methane inhibitors (30% enteric reduction)
  - Manure system upgrades (20% manure reduction)
  - Improved genetics (10% overall efficiency)
  - Energy efficiency measures
  - Heat recovery systems
  - Renewable energy adoption
  - Precision agriculture
- **Waterfall Visualization**: Shows step-by-step path to lower emissions
- **Cost-Effectiveness Ranking**: Prioritizes measures by ¬£/tonne CO‚ÇÇe

### 3. Green Financing Module
- **5 Financing Options**:
  - Green Agriculture Loans (1.5% discount)
  - Government Grants (up to 40% coverage)
  - Carbon Credit Programs (¬£25/tonne)
  - Sustainability-Linked Bonds

### 4. Scenario-Finance Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Financing adjusts as scenarios change
- **Practice-Specific Costs**: Each toggle shows investment needed
- **ROI per Practice**: Understand financial return of each change
- **Integrated Risk Assessment**: Lower emissions = better loan terms

### 5. Enhanced Exports
- **Comprehensive Data**: All V4 metrics included
- **Multiple Formats**: CSV, JSON, PDF/Print
- **New Fields**:
  - Theoretical minimum analysis
  - Reduction pathway details
  - Financing recommendations
  - 10-year projections

2. Look for the purple "TM" indicator
3. Check your "% above TM" metric
4. Review suggested reduction measures

### Planning Your Reduction Pathway
1. View the **Reduction Pathway** waterfall chart
2. Measures are ranked by cost-effectiveness
3. Toggle measures to see cumulative impact
4. Check if you can reach TM with available options

### Accessing Green Financing
1. Visit **Financing Dashboard**
2. Review eligible financing options
3. See automatic package optimization
4. Compare NPV and payback periods
