# üß™ Stakeholder Testing Scenarios - GHG WHAT-IF Tool

## Overview
This document provides test scenarios for stakeholder validation of the GHG WHAT-IF Tool V4. Each scenario represents a real-world farm configuration to validate calculations and user experience.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Performing Pasture Farm
**Profile**: Efficient grass-based system with excellent genetics

**Parameters**:
- Herd Size: 200 cows
- Milk Yield: 7,500 L/cow/year
- System Type: Pasture
- Feed Quality: 9/10
- Concentrate Feed: 4 kg/day
- Nitrogen Rate: 150 kg N/ha
- Avg Lactations: 4.5
- Calving Interval: 365 days
- Loan Amount: ¬£100,000

**Expected Results**:
- LME Score: ~7,000-8,000
- NUE: ~40-45%
- Risk Score: Low (20-30)
- Should be ~10-20% above TM

**Validation Points**:
- ‚úì Emissions should be lower due to pasture system
- ‚úì High LME due to good efficiency
- ‚úì Low risk due to good performance
- ‚úì Eligible for green financing

### Scenario 2: Intensive Confined System
**Profile**: High-yielding confined system with moderate efficiency

**Parameters**:
- Herd Size: 500 cows
- Milk Yield: 11,000 L/cow/year

**Expected Results**:
- LME Score: ~5,500-6,500
- NUE: ~25-30%
- Risk Score: Moderate (40-50)
- Should be ~40-60% above TM

**Validation Points**:
- ‚úì Higher emissions from confined system
- ‚úì Moderate LME despite high yield
- ‚úì Lower NUE due to high inputs
- ‚úì Performance penalties applied

### Scenario 3: Struggling Small Farm
**Profile**: Small farm with poor KPIs and high debt

**Parameters**:
- Herd Size: 80 cows
- Milk Yield: 6,000 L/cow/year
- System Type: Hybrid
- Feed Quality: 5/10
- Concentrate Feed: 6 kg/day
- Nitrogen Rate: 200 kg N/ha
- Avg Lactations: 2.5
- Calving Interval: 420 days
- Loan Amount: ¬£150,000

**Expected Results**:
- LME Score: ~3,500-4,500
- NUE: ~20-25%
- Risk Score: High (60-70)
- Should be ~80-100% above TM

**Validation Points**:
- ‚úì Poor performance triggers penalties
- ‚úì High debt/cow ratio increases risk
- ‚úì Multiple reduction measures needed
- ‚úì May struggle to reach TM

### Scenario 4: Progressive Carbon-Neutral Farm
**Profile**: Farm implementing multiple mitigation measures

**Parameters**:
- Herd Size: 250 cows
- Milk Yield: 8,500 L/cow/year
- System Type: Hybrid
- Feed Quality: 8/10
- Concentrate Feed: 8 kg/day
- Nitrogen Rate: 180 kg N/ha
- Avg Lactations: 4.0
- Calving Interval: 375 days
- Loan Amount: ¬£200,000
- **Mitigation Measures**:
  - Trees: 50/ha
  - Hedgerows: 5,000m
  - Cover Crops: 100 ha
  - Renewable Energy: 100 kW
  - Methane Inhibitor: Yes
  - Improved Manure: Yes

**Expected Results**:
- LME Score: ~6,500-7,500
- NUE: ~35-40%
- Risk Score: Very Low (10-20)
- Should be approaching TM

**Validation Points**:
- ‚úì Significant sequestration offsets
- ‚úì Methane reduction visible
- ‚úì Excellent financing options
- ‚úì Near or at theoretical minimum

|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 0-20 | Very Low | Excellent performance, low debt | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No |
| 20-40 | Low | Good performance, manageable debt | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No |
| 40-60 | Moderate | Average performance or debt concerns | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No |
| 60-80 | High | Poor performance or high debt | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No |
| 80-100 | Very High | Critical issues requiring action | ‚òê Yes ‚òê No |
