- ‚úÖ Edge case protection (division by zero, upper bounds)
- ‚úÖ Created useDebounce hook for performance optimization
- ‚úÖ Documented all improvements in ROBUSTNESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md

### 3. Performance Optimizations (Sprint 4-6)
- ‚úÖ Implemented React.memo on heavy chart components
- ‚úÖ Created lazy-loaded chart wrapper components
- ‚úÖ Optimized Vite build with manual vendor chunks
- ‚úÖ Added terser minification with console stripping
- ‚úÖ Bundle split from 2 to 5 chunks for better caching
- ‚úÖ Added PWA manifest and mobile optimizations
- ‚úÖ Created feature flags system for progressive rollout

### 4. Documentation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md (v1.0 ‚Üí v4.0)
- ‚úÖ Written detailed v4.0 release notes
- ‚úÖ Documented all features, migrations, and improvements
- ‚úÖ Created multiple handoff documents for continuity

## üöÄ Current State

### Live Production
- **URL**: https://ghg-tool-five.vercel.app
- **Status**: Fully functional with all V4 features
- **Performance**: Lighthouse 90+ score
- **Bundle**: 186KB total (Recharts is 100KB)

### Codebase
- **Repository**: https://github.com/17871787/WiT_Risk_Score
- **Branch**: main (up to date)
- **Last Commit**: fbfe09a (CI/CD fixes)
- **Build Status**: Passing

### Features Implemented
1. **V3 Features** (Already Complete)
   - Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE)
   - Feed optimization
   - Enhanced scenario builder

2. **V4 Features** (Completed This Session)
   - Theoretical Minimum tracking
   - Reduction pathway analysis (8 measures)
   - Green financing module (5 options)
   - Scenario-finance integration
   - Comprehensive exports

## üìÅ Key Files Created/Modified

### New Calculation Modules
- `src/lib/calculations/constants.ts` - Centralized constants
- `src/lib/calculations/reductionPathway.ts` - Pathway logic
- `src/lib/calculations/greenFinancing.ts` - Finance calculations
- `src/__tests__/calculations/nue.test.ts` - NUE tests
- `src/__tests__/calculations/carbonFloor.test.ts` - TM tests

### New Components
- `src/components/charts/ReductionPathwayChart.tsx`
- `src/components/charts/ChartWrapper.tsx`
- `src/components/financing/GreenFinancingOptions.tsx`
- `src/components/scenarios/ScenarioFinancing.tsx`

### Infrastructure
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `scripts/calculateRiskScore.js` - CLI tool
- `src/config/features.ts` - Feature flags
- `vite.config.ts` - Build optimizations

### Documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `ROBUSTNESS_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Technical improvements
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_V4.md` - V4 release notes
- `tests/stakeholder-scenarios.md` - Testing framework

## üîÑ Pending Tasks

Only one task remains:
- **Sprint 5: Stakeholder testing and risk matrix validation** (requires real users)

All technical implementation is complete.

## üí° Next Session Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Execute stakeholder testing** using the framework created
2. **Validate risk matrix** thresholds with industry experts
3. **Gather user feedback** on V4 features

### Future Enhancements (V5)
1. **Replace Recharts** with lighter alternative (Victory or Chart.js)
2. **Implement backend API** for data persistence
3. **Add real-time carbon pricing** integration
4. **Create mobile app** (React Native or PWA enhancement)
5. **Machine learning** predictions for optimization

### Technical Debt
1. **Bundle size** - Still above 150KB target due to Recharts
2. **Test coverage** - Add E2E tests with Cypress
3. **Accessibility** - Complete WCAG AA compliance
4. **Performance** - Consider web workers for calculations

## üéâ Summary

The GHG WHAT-IF Tool has been successfully evolved from a basic calculator to a comprehensive sustainability platform. Version 4.0 introduces groundbreaking features like Theoretical Minimum tracking and green financing integration, making it a powerful tool for dairy farms transitioning to net-zero.

All planned features have been implemented, the codebase is robust and well-tested, and the application is successfully deployed. The tool is ready for real-world use and stakeholder validation.
