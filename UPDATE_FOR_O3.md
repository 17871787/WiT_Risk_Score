# 🧠 Comprehensive Update for O3 - GHG WHAT-IF Tool Progress

## 📅 Session Timeline
**Start**: ~1 hour ago  
**Focus**: Debugging deployment issues, implementing V3/V4 features, and preparing documentation  
**Current Status**: All features deployed, comprehensive documentation complete

## 🚨 Critical Issue Resolved

### The Problem
- User reported "many features are missing" from the production deployment
- Investigation revealed production URL was serving an OLD build
- New features (Feed Tuning, NUE, TM line) were built but not deployed to the main URL

### The Solution
1. Force redeployed with `vercel --prod --force`
2. Updated production alias to point to new deployment
3. Verified all features now visible at https://ghg-tool-five.vercel.app

## 🎯 Major Implementations Completed

### V3 Features - Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE)
**What we built:**
1. **NUE Calculation Engine** (`src/lib/calculations/nue.ts`)
   - Formula: NUE = (Milk N Output / Total N Input) × 100
   - Tracks nitrogen balance and environmental losses
   - Provides recommendations for improvement

2. **NUE Display Components**
   - `NUEDisplay.tsx` - Shows NUE percentage, inputs/outputs, recommendations
   - `LMEPlusDisplay.tsx` - Combined LME+NUE sustainability metric
   - Added to EffectivenessDashboard

3. **Feed Tuning Component** (`src/components/FeedTuning.tsx`)
   - Feed Quality slider (1-10 scale)
   - Concentrate Feed amount (kg/day)
   - Feed Carbon Footprint (kg CO₂e/kg)
   - Integrated into BasicDashboard

### V4 Features - Theoretical Minimum (TM)
**What we built:**
1. **Carbon Floor Calculations** (`src/lib/calculations/carbonFloor.ts`)
   - TM = 2000 kg CO₂e/cow/year (biological minimum)
   - Calculates % above TM and gap to reach it
   - Identifies reduction opportunities

2. **Enhanced Glide Path** (`src/hooks/useGlidePath.ts`)
   - 10-year projections with 2% annual tech improvement
   - Shows TM as purple dashed line on chart
   - Indicates when TM and net-zero achieved

3. **Updated Components**
   - `NetCarbonProjectionV2.tsx` - New chart with TM line
   - `FarmImpactV2.tsx` - Shows TM status banner
   - Both integrated into their respective dashboards

## 📊 Current Feature Status

### ✅ Working in Production
1. **Core Features** (V1-V2)
   - Emissions calculations with performance penalties
   - Risk scoring based on emissions + loan amount
   - Scenario builder with 6 practice toggles
   - Loan calculator with risk-based rates

2. **V3 Features** (Nitrogen Focus)
   - Feed parameter controls
   - NUE calculations and display
   - LME+NUE combined metric
   - Recommendations system

3. **V4 Features** (Biological Floor)
   - Theoretical Minimum tracking
   - Enhanced glide path with TM line
   - Performance vs TM metrics
   - Hover tooltips on projections

### 📈 Key Metrics Achieved
- Emissions properly calibrated to 0.78 kg CO₂e/L minimum
- Fertility metrics (age at first calving, lactations) properly impact emissions
- NUE calculation accounts for feed and fertilizer nitrogen
- TM provides clear target for farms to achieve

## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### State Management
- Zustand store manages 40+ parameters
- All calculations memoized for performance
- Clean data flow: User Input → Store → Hooks → Components

2. **COMPONENT_MAP.md** - All 40+ components mapped with relationships
3. **STATE_AND_DATA_FLOW.md** - Zustand state management and data flow
4. **CALCULATION_MAP.md** - All formulas, constants, and calculation locations
5. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Development setup and deployment procedures

### Handoff Documentation
1. **AUTOCOMPACT_CREDENTIALS.md** - Deployment preferences and auth status
2. **SESSION_STATE.md** - Current development position
3. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Quick reference and key facts

## 🔧 Technical Details You Need to Know

### Calculation Formulas Added
```typescript
// NUE Calculation
NUE = (Milk_Yield × 0.0055) / (Applied_N + Feed_N) × 100

// Theoretical Minimum
TM = Herd_Size × 2000 kg CO₂e/year

// LME+NUE Combined
LME+NUE = LME × (NUE / 100)
Sustainability_Score = (LME/15 × 50) + (NUE/150 × 50)
```

### Key Constants
- MILK_N_CONTENT: 0.0055 kg N/L
- TM_BASE_PER_COW: 2000 kg CO₂e/year
- ANNUAL_TECH_REDUCTION: 2% per year
- NUE_THRESHOLDS: Poor <60%, Average 60-80%, Good 80-100%

## 🚀 Next Development Phase

### V4 Sprint 2: Reduction Pathway Logic (Ready to Start)
**Goal**: Show specific interventions needed to reach TM by 2035

**Tasks**:
1. Create `reductionPathway.ts` calculation module
2. Build visualization showing "Current → TM → Net Zero"
3. Calculate impact of:
   - Feed quality improvements
   - Methane inhibitors
   - Manure system upgrades
   - Other interventions

**Implementation Plan**:
```typescript
// New calculation needed
calculateReductionOpportunities(params) → {
  feedQualityImprovement: number,
  methaneInhibitorAdoption: boolean,
  manureSystemUpgrade: string,
  totalPotentialReduction: number,
  canReachTM: boolean
}
```
