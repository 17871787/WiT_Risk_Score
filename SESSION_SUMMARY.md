# GHG WHAT-IF Tool - Session Summary

## Project Overview
A React/TypeScript application for dairy farm greenhouse gas optimization with financial risk assessment and loan recommendations.

## Key Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Initial Refactoring
- Refactored 4000+ line monolithic component into 40+ modular TypeScript files
- Implemented Zustand for state management
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types
- Fixed critical bugs (division by zero, parseInt issues)

### 2. Deployment & CI/CD
- Successfully deployed to Vercel at https://ghg-tool-five.vercel.app
- Set up Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/17871787/WiT_Risk_Score
- Resolved TypeScript/react-scripts conflicts by migrating to Vite

### 3. Risk Score & Loan Calculator
- Implemented composite risk scoring (emissions + loan leverage)
- Created loan calculator with risk-based interest rates
- Interest rate matrix varies by risk score and loan amount
- Added visual risk badges and loan tier indicators

### 4. Scenario Builder (Quick Win)
- Added Scenarios tab with 6 pre-configured practices
- Created toggle-based UI (not sliders) for better UX
- Built side-by-side comparison showing baseline vs scenario
- Real-time impact calculations with percentage changes

### 5. Dashboard Architecture
- Created ViewContext for global tab state management
- Built 6 dashboard components (Basic, Farm, Heifer, Sequestration, Effectiveness, Scenarios)
- Implemented useDashboardState/Actions hooks to prevent prop drilling
- Reduced bundle size by 66% (570KB → 193KB)

### 6. Documentation
- Created TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md with all equations and constants
- Added llms.txt for AI assistant context
- Created ROADMAP.md for three-phase journey (Measure → Model → Products)
- Added comprehensive README files

## Critical Files for Next Session

### Core Architecture
```
src/
├── App.tsx                    # Main app with dashboard switching
├── context/
│   ├── FarmContext.tsx       # Zustand store for farm state
│   └── ViewContext.tsx       # Global tab state
├── hooks/
│   ├── useCalculations.ts    # Memoized calculations
│   └── useDashboardState.ts  # Dashboard data aggregation
└── dashboards/              # 6 dashboard components
```

### Key Components
```
src/components/
├── Sidebar.tsx              # Tab navigation
├── LoanCalculator.tsx       # Financial options
├── scenarios/
│   ├── ScenarioBuilder.tsx  # Practice toggles
│   └── ScenarioComparison.tsx # Side-by-side view
```

### Calculations
```
src/lib/calculations/
├── emissions.ts     # Core GHG calculations
├── lme.ts          # Lifetime Methane Efficiency
├── economics.ts    # Cost analysis
├── risk.ts         # Risk scoring & loans
└── performance.ts  # Farm metrics
```

### Constants
```
src/constants/
├── emissions.ts    # All emission factors, thresholds
└── ui.ts          # UI configuration
```

## State Shape
```typescript
// FarmContext state
{
  parameters: FarmParameters,  // 30+ farm inputs
  loanAmount: number,
  loanTerm: number,
  updateParameter: Function,
  updateLoanParameter: Function
}

// ViewContext state
{
  activeTab: TabType,  // 'basic' | 'farm' | etc.
  setActiveTab: Function
}
```

## Key Formulas
1. **Emissions**: `(Enteric + Feed + Manure + Energy) × 365 + N2O`
2. **Risk Score**: Base on emissions intensity + loan leverage bumps
3. **LME**: `Lifetime Production / Lifetime Emissions × System Factor`
4. **Interest Rate**: Matrix lookup by risk score & loan amount

## Next Phase Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Post-Compact)
- [x] Migrate existing JSX into dashboard components
- [x] Implement lazy loading for chart libraries
- [x] Add Suspense boundaries for code splitting
- [x] Dashboard migration completed successfully

### Sprint 0: Tech Debt
- [ ] Move remaining constants to centralized location
- [ ] Add scenario snapshot/restore functionality
- [ ] Create investment calculation engine

### Layer 1: Measure
- [ ] CSV import functionality
- [ ] Data validation dashboard
- [ ] API connectors for milk recording systems

### Layer 2: Model
- [x] Basic scenario builder (completed)
- [ ] Investment ROI calculator
- [ ] PDF export with charts
- [ ] Multi-scenario management

### Layer 3: Products
- [ ] Barclays product API integration
- [ ] Eligibility engine
- [ ] Pre-filled loan applications
