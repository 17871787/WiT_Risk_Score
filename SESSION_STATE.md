# Session State - GHG WHAT-IF Tool Development

## üìç Current Position

**Date**: August 2, 2025
**Session Focus**: Architecture documentation and deployment fixes
**Last Action**: Created comprehensive documentation for auto-compact

## ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

1. **Fixed Production Deployment**
   - Identified old deployment was being served
   - Force redeployed with `vercel --prod --force`
   - Updated production alias to latest build
   - Verified all features now visible at https://ghg-tool-five.vercel.app

2. **Created Architecture Documentation**
   - ARCHITECTURE.md - System overview
   - COMPONENT_MAP.md - Component hierarchy
   - STATE_AND_DATA_FLOW.md - State management
   - CALCULATION_MAP.md - All formulas
   - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - Dev/deploy procedures
   - AUTOCOMPACT_CREDENTIALS.md - Handoff credentials

## üöÄ Development Progress

### V3 Features (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Feed parameters in Basic dashboard
- ‚úÖ Sprint 2: NUE (Nitrogen Use Efficiency) calculations
- ‚úÖ NUE display components
- ‚úÖ LME+NUE combined metric

### V4 Features (Partially Complete)
- ‚úÖ Sprint 0: Theoretical Minimum foundation
- ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Net-Carbon Glide Path 2.0 with TM line
- ‚è≥ Sprint 2: Reduction Pathway logic (Next)
- ‚è≥ Sprint 3: Green Financing module
- ‚è≥ Sprint 4: Link financing to scenarios
- ‚è≥ Sprint 5: Documentation and exports

## üíæ Repository State

```bash
# Current branch
main

# Latest commit
2d8ac44 - docs: comprehensive architecture documentation for auto-compact

# Clean working tree
No uncommitted changes

# Deployment status
Production deployed and working
```

## üîß Active Configurations

### Environment
- **Node**: 16+
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4.5.14
- **Framework**: React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **State**: Zustand 4.4.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.0

### Key Files Modified Recently
1. Created new documentation files (5 files)
2. Updated BasicDashboard with FarmImpactV2
3. Updated SequestrationDashboard with NetCarbonProjectionV2
4. Updated EffectivenessDashboard with NUE displays

## üéØ Next Immediate Tasks

### V4 Sprint 2: Reduction Pathway Logic
1. Calculate reduction opportunities to reach TM
2. Show "Current gap ‚Üí TM ‚Üí Net Zero" visualization
3. Identify specific measures needed (feed quality, inhibitors, etc.)

### Code Location for Next Sprint
- Create: `src/lib/calculations/reductionPathway.ts`
- Create: `src/components/charts/ReductionPathway.tsx`
- Update: `src/dashboards/SequestrationDashboard.tsx`

## üìù Important Context

### What Works Well
- All calculations are properly memoized
- Component architecture is clean and modular
- TypeScript types are comprehensive
- Deployment pipeline is smooth

### Known Considerations
- Bundle size is ~170KB (acceptable but watch growth)
- Some components could be further optimized
- No backend/API - all client-side calculations

### User Feedback Integration
- Emissions calculations properly calibrated to 0.78 minimum
- Overflow menu implemented for sidebar tabs
- Fertility metrics now properly impact emissions
- Loan calculator moved to main content area

## üîë Key Commands for Continuation

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\jtowe\ghg-tool

# Start development
npm run dev

# Check current deployment
vercel ls

# Deploy updates
vercel --prod

# View changes
git log --oneline -10
```

## üìä Metrics

- **Total Components**: 40+
- **Test Coverage**: Core calculations tested
- **Bundle Size**: 172KB gzipped
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+
- **Load Time**: <2s on 3G

## üö¶ Ready for Handoff

The project is in a stable state with:
- ‚úÖ All code committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ Production deployment working
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Clear next steps defined
- ‚úÖ Authentication configured
