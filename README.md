# GHG WHAT-IF Tool

[![Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/17871787/WiT_Risk_Score/actions/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/17871787/WiT_Risk_Score/actions/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml)

A comprehensive React/TypeScript application for dairy farm greenhouse gas (GHG) optimization and carbon footprint analysis.

🚧 **Version 3.0 In Development**: Integrating Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) into sustainability metrics. See [V3_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./V3_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for details.

## Features

- **Real-time GHG calculations** with seasonal adjustments
- **Lifetime Methane Efficiency (LME)** tracking
- **Carbon sequestration** planning and tracking
- **Economic analysis** with cost breakdowns
- **10-year carbon projection** modeling
- **Green financing** recommendations
- **Export functionality** for comprehensive CSV reports

## Architecture

The application has been refactored from a monolithic 4000+ line component into a modular, maintainable architecture:

```
src/
├── components/          # UI components
│   ├── charts/         # Data visualization components
│   ├── parameters/     # Parameter input components
│   └── ui/            # Reusable UI elements
├── constants/          # Application constants
├── context/           # State management (Zustand)
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
├── lib/               # Business logic
│   ├── calculations/  # Core calculation functions
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
└── types/             # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Key Improvements

### Performance
- Memoized calculations using `useMemo`
- Efficient state management with Zustand
- Optimized re-renders with proper component splitting

### Safety
- Safe division operations preventing division by zero
- Input validation and sanitization
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling

### Maintainability
- Modular component architecture
- Separated business logic from UI
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns
